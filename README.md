# pi-fan-controller-hass
Home Assistant Add-on for controlling the fan in RPi using GPIO.

The addon has been tested on HomeAssistant OS / RPi 4 only.

To install, just follow the [official documentation](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/add-ons/tutorial) on how to build a custom local addon.

Please, feel free to propose PR to make this repo better. A potential improvement is to make the GPIO pin and min/max temperatures configurables.
